# Location Alarm MVP 📍⏰

Location Alarm is a smart, GPS-based alarm application designed specifically for commuters. It ensures you never miss your stop by triggering a high-priority alarm as you approach your destination, even if you've fallen asleep or are distracted during your travel.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Real-Time Destination Search:** Powered by the **Photon API (OpenStreetMap)**, featuring 500ms debouncing, location-biased auto-suggestions, and persistent search history.
- **Interactive MapLibre Integration:** Smooth map interface with **Auto-Zoom** to selected destinations and floating controls for **One-Tap Refocus** and **Location Refresh**.
- **Proximity Alarms:** High-precision distance calculations to ensure arrival coverage.
- **Background Guardian:** A dedicated **Foreground Service** tracks your location and maintains alarm readiness even when the app is in the background or the screen is off.
- **Hardware-Level Alarm Engine:** High-priority sound and haptic vibration loops that bypass standard notification limitations.
- **Modern Material 3 UI:** Entirely built with Jetpack Compose, featuring a "Deep Dark" mode for OLED efficiency and a seamless "Guardian" status system.
- **Full Customization:** User-configurable wake-up distance, system ringtone selection, vibration toggles, and persistent Theme Management (Light/Dark/System).

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The project follows a robust **Clean Architecture** pattern with a unidirectional data flow.

### 🗺️ Data & Logic Flow
`UI (Compose)` ↔ `ViewModel` ↔ `Service / API / Engine`

- **UI Layer:** State-only Jetpack Compose screens. `MapScreen` observes state flows and handles navigation to `SettingsScreen`.
- **ViewModel Layer:** `MapViewModel` manages state, persists history/preferences via `SharedPreferences`, and orchestrates search/alarm logic.
- **Service/Engine Layer:**
    - `LocationAlarmService`: Foreground Service for background tracking and distance monitoring.
    - `LocationTrackingManager`: Handles the FusedLocationProviderClient.
    - `AlarmEngine`: Hardware abstraction for Ringtone and Vibrator APIs.
